**Python Engineering Projects**

This repository contains three Python projects demonstrating automation, ETL workflows, and control-system logic simulation. They were designed to reflect a structured engineering mindset and to support applications for roles involving control systems, automation, HVAC, and data-driven engineering workflows.

Repository Contents:
Automation Script: Automated report generator that cleans data, performs calculations, and produces daily monitoring summaries.

ETL Temperature Pipeline: End-to-end ETL pipeline for temperature sensor logs, including anomaly detection. Reflects typical preprocessing required for cooling-system monitoring.

Cooling System Controller Simulation: A Python simulation modelling simple decision logic used in cooling and HVAC control systems.

Each project includes:
• Python scripts
• Sample datasets
• Documentation
